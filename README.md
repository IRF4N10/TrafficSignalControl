## TrafficSignalControl
Adaptive Traffic Signal Control using YOLO based vehicle detection.<br>
<h5>Introduction:</h5><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system proposes an adaptive traffic control system utilizing the YOLO object detection framework, to provide traffic signal lights at an at-grade four leg intersection with minimum human involvemnet. It uses the YOLOv8 model, trained on our primary dataset, to detect the vehicles on each road at the intersection. This captured information is further passed onto the intersection control algorithm, which then provides the traffic signal.
